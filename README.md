# Description
For homework 2 continued my scene from homework 1. The four types of lighting that I have in my scene are a directional light, point light, spot light and emissive material. The directional light rotates around creating a day night cycle. For the particle system I added both a 2d billboard and 3d mesh emitter. The 2d is the fire breath from the dragon and the 3d emitter is the bubbles coming from the water.

# Lights
- Directional light
- Spotlight on main character
- Emissive material on mushrooms and water bubbles
- Point light at the tiger in the corner

# Particle Emitters
- Dragons breath in the sky (2D)
- Water bubbles (3D)
